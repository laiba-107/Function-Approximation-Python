# Scripts
# Linear Approximation:

This script performs a linear approximation of a user-defined function at a specified point.

# Newton's Method:

This script implements Newton's method to find the roots of a function within a specified interval.

# Trapezoidal Rule:

This script uses the Trapezoidal rule to approximate the area under a curve for a given function.

# Midpoint Rule:

This script uses the Midpoint rule to approximate the area under a curve for a given function.

# Simpson's Rule:

This script uses Simpson's rule to approximate the area under a curve for a given function.

# Riemann Sum:

This script calculates the left and right Riemann sums to approximate the area under a curve for a given function.
